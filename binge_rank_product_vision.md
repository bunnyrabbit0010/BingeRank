**Product Vision: BingeRank (Working Title)**

**Overview**
BingeRank is a personalized, socially-driven platform for tracking, ranking, and discovering TV shows. Inspired by the success of Beli in the restaurant space, BingeRank aims to bring emotionally resonant and taste-aware experiences to TV lovers. It goes beyond simple watchlists and reviews to build a dynamic taste profile, offer social compatibility scores, and power meaningful recommendations through context, mood, and smart comparisons.

**Mission Statement**
Help people fall in love with TV again by making it more personal, social, and emotionally aligned with their tastes.

**Target Audience**
- TV enthusiasts looking to track and rank their favorite shows.
- Social users who want to compare and discover shows through friends.
- Casual viewers overwhelmed by too many options on streaming services.
- Niche community members who want taste-aligned group recommendations.

**Key Differentiators**
1. **Taste Graph & Compatibility**: Understand user tastes deeply and match them with others.
2. **Pairwise Show Ranking**: Ask “Which did you like more?” to build dynamic smart rankings.
3. **Mood-Tagged Experiences**: Enable mood-based filtering and tagging of shows.
4. **Social Circles & Watch Parties**: Join micro-communities or shared watchlists.
5. **Life-Stage Personalization**: Curated recommendations based on lifestyle and current situation.

**Core Features**
- Taste Profile (genres, pacing, tone, cast preferences, etc.)
- Compatibility Score with friends & followers
- Smart Ranking System (Elo or pairwise comparison model)
- Mood-based show tagging and filters
- Shared Watchlists, Challenges, and Group Recs
- Real-time availability checker via JustWatch/Watchmode
- Feed of friends’ activity (recently ranked, started watching, finished)

**Experience Goals**
- Delight users with high-fidelity taste matching and recs.
- Encourage social bonding over TV.
- Help users cut through choice paralysis with better filters.
- Make the ranking process fun and emotional.

**Why Now**
- Streaming fatigue and content overload are real.
- Beli and Letterboxd have shown the power of taste-based social apps.
- Serialized and TV Time exist, but lack smart comparisons and emotional UX.
- There’s a white space for a TV-focused app with stronger personal and social intelligence.

**Success Metrics**
- Daily/weekly active users
- % of users completing a Taste Profile
- Show-to-show comparison completions
- Friend connections and compatibility checks
- Retention rate after 30/90 days

**Future Opportunities**
- Creator tools for curators and tastemakers
- Subscription newsletter or concierge for tailored weekly recs
- Licensing data or insights to media companies
- Expansion into film, podcasts, or games once core is strong

**Business Model & Exit Strategy**

**Monetization Approaches:**
1. **Freemium Model** – Offer core ranking and discovery features for free, while charging for:
   - Advanced taste insights
   - Personalized concierge recs
   - Ad-free experience
   - “Pro” mode with social graph analytics

2. **Affiliate Streaming Revenue** – Earn commission from referrals or new signups when users click through to streaming platforms via Watchmode/JustWatch links.

3. **Creator Tools & Subscriptions** – Enable critics, curators, and influencers to build lists, publish recs, and monetize via tips, subscriptions, or unlockable lists.

4. **Data Licensing** – Sell anonymized taste graph data and trend insights to:
   - Streaming services
   - Studios or producers
   - Media analytics firms

5. **White-Label or B2B Licensing** – Package BingeRank’s taste engine as an API or SDK for use by other content platforms and apps.

**Exit Potential:**
- Acquisition targets include:
   - Streaming platforms (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+)
   - Media companies (e.g., Warner Bros., NBCUniversal)
   - Consumer discovery apps (e.g., Discord, Pinterest)
   - Entertainment metadata firms (e.g., Gracenote, Watchmode)

- Value levers:
   - Unique taste graph + social graph
   - Strong engagement and retention in early cohorts
   - Rich, structured emotional feedback on content
   - Distribution and creator layer for content tastemakers

**Product Requirements Document (PRD): MVP Scope**

**Objective**
Build an MVP of BingeRank that captures the core experience of tracking and ranking TV shows with a social and taste-based twist.

**MVP Goals**
- Deliver a compelling personal experience through ranking and taste profiling.
- Enable social comparison and discovery among early users.
- Provide lightweight show metadata and availability to enrich decision-making.

**MVP Feature Set**

1. **User Authentication**
   - Sign up/login (email + social options)
   - Basic profile creation

2. **Search & Show Details**
   - Search by title using TMDb API
   - View basic metadata (poster, description, genres, year, cast)

3. **Ranking System**
   - Head-to-head comparisons: “Which show do you prefer?”
   - Dynamic personal rankings list

4. **Taste Profile**
   - Auto-generated from user rankings
   - Display dominant genres, tones, show types

5. **Social Graph (Lightweight)**
   - Follow/unfollow users
   - See a friend’s current ranking list

6. **Availability Info**
   - Integration with JustWatch or Watchmode API
   - Show where a title is currently streaming

7. **Activity Feed**
   - Show friends’ recent activity (e.g., new ranking, finished a show)

**Out of Scope (for MVP)**
- Watch party feature
- Group challenges or shared watchlists
- Mood tagging or life-stage recommendations
- Advanced filtering and recommendation engine

**Tech Stack (Proposed)**
- Frontend: React Native or Flutter (iOS/Android)
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- APIs: TMDb (metadata), JustWatch/Watchmode (availability), Firebase/Auth0 (auth)

**Timeline**
- Week 1–2: UI mockups + backend scaffolding
- Week 3–5: Core ranking engine + show search + taste profile
- Week 6–8: Social graph, availability integration, activity feed
- Week 9–10: QA, polish, and beta launch

**Success Criteria for MVP**
- 500 users complete >10 head-to-head comparisons
- 60% of users generate a taste profile
- >30% of users connect with at least one friend
- Engagement rate (weekly active users) > 25%

**Technical Architecture (MVP)**

**Frontend (Mobile App)**
- React Native app for iOS and Android
- Communicates with backend via REST APIs
- Auth via Firebase or Auth0 SDK
- Shows search, comparisons, profiles, and social feed

**Backend (FastAPI in Python)**
- RESTful API layer to handle requests from mobile app
- Handles business logic (rankings, taste profile generation, activity feed)
- Integrates with TMDb and JustWatch APIs
- Serves availability and metadata

**Database (PostgreSQL)**
- Users, shows, rankings, follows, activity
- Taste profile generated from stored ranking data
- Consider graph DB for future if social graph complexity grows

**Third-Party Services**
- **TMDb API**: Show metadata
- **JustWatch or Watchmode API**: Streaming availability
- **Firebase/Auth0**: Authentication and session management

**Deployment**
For fast iteration and low cost during the MVP phase:
- **Backend Hosting**: Render, Railway, or Fly.io for FastAPI service
- **Database**: Supabase or Neon for managed PostgreSQL
- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel or Expo for web previews

These platforms offer generous free tiers or low-cost starter plans suitable for MVPs. As usage grows, components can be migrated to AWS (e.g., RDS, ECS, Lambda, Cognito) for long-term scale, control, and enterprise needs.
